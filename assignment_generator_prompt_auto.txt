# Fully Automated Assignment Generator Prompt for Copilot

Use this prompt with GitHub Copilot (or Copilot Chat) to generate a complete Android assignment with robust test cases, Docker image, and all required files. Just paste your starter and solution XML code in the marked sections.

**Prompt:**

I want to generate a new Android assignment for my web platform. Please do the following:

1. Use the following XML as the starter code (put this in startercode.zip as activity_main.xml):

[PASTE YOUR STARTER XML CODE HERE]

2. Use the following XML as the solution code (put this in solution.zip as activity_main.xml):

[PASTE YOUR SOLUTION XML CODE HERE]

3. Automatically create a new assignment folder in the root directory, named assignmentN (where N is the next available number, e.g., assignment3 if assignment2 exists).

4. Automatically set the assignment ID to a unique 3-digit number (e.g., 003, 004, ...).

5. Automatically generate a description based on the starter and solution XML (e.g., mention the layout type, number of TextViews, and any constraints present).

6. Generate all required files and folders for the assignment, including:
   - Dockerfile
   - docker-compose.yml
   - runner.sh
   - enhance_json.py
   - conftest.py
   - pytest.ini
   - test_assignment.py (with at least 10 robust test cases for Android XML validation)
   - startercode.zip
   - solution.zip
   - ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md, src/
   - Build the Docker image (x86) and save as x86.tar

7. Do not leave any placeholder test files—ensure test_assignment.py is always robust and complete.
